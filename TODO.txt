use simpler remote mining drop model.
    remote miners should be dropping every turn either in a container or on the ground
    truckers should go to the pickup flag and look for energy either on the ground or in container
use global.* for global things?
Reform census/population management system:
    Esp. The ill-advised prioritizing of supported rooms over the ones supporting them.
    New system:
        A room performs a census every so often, recording all the creeps that call that room their home room. The rooms may or may not have a spawn.
        When creeps are lacking, they are put in the memory of the room to spawn them as a request to spawn.
        When the spawn room is not this room, there is an additional tag on the request indicating so
        Each room with a spawn then sorts the requests (address the local room needs first, in this priority order, then address the needs of each dependent room, in that room's priority order)

Setup cputrack for individual roles in effort to find ways to increase efficiency
start mining minerals
develop soldier/healer pairs to take rooms/harvest energy
