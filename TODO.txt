In light of recent attack, find best qualifier for a serious room threat, and activate safe mode automatically.
    A good qualifier would probably be if the guard in the room is killed
        Can tell by:
            putting guards in memory each tick, along with the time to live
            if a guard in memory is not in Game.creeps, and the time to live was greater than, like, 2, then this is a serious threat
        Then if the guard's room is in Game.rooms, try to activate a safe mode, and email me with the result
    Then, find ways to spawn more guards as soon as enemy appears (just bump up desired number?)
    Have towers make wise decisions about firing on an enemy (wait till close?)
Implement two spawns in a room, should also help with when invaders show up
use global.* for global things?
Reform census/population management system:
    Esp. The ill-advised prioritizing of supported rooms over the ones supporting them.
    New system:
        A room performs a census every so often, recording all the creeps that call that room their home room. The rooms may or may not have a spawn.
        When creeps are lacking, they are put in the memory of the room to spawn them as a request to spawn.
        When the spawn room is not this room, there is an additional tag on the request indicating so
        Each room with a spawn then sorts the requests (address the local room needs first, in this priority order, then address the needs of each dependent room, in that room's priority order)

Setup cputrack for individual roles in effort to find ways to increase efficiency
start mining minerals
develop soldier/healer pairs to take rooms/get power
